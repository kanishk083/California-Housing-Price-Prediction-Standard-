# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction (Standard)

This project aims to predict **median housing prices in California districts** using the **California Housing Dataset**.  
The workflow follows the complete **machine learning pipeline** — from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

The **California Housing Price Model** uses real-world housing data to analyze patterns and build predictive models.  
This project is ideal for understanding how various factors — like **income, population, location, and housing age** — influence housing prices.

---

## 🧩 Project Objectives

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns and correlations.  
2. **Prepare and clean** the dataset for machine learning algorithms.  
3. Implement **feature engineering** and **data transformations**.  
4. Train various **regression models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
5. Evaluate model performance using key metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).  
6. Optimize and fine-tune the best-performing model.

## 🔍 Current Progress

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualized geographical data using scatter plots (latitude vs longitude).  
- Explored relationships between housing features and median house values.  
- Identified correlations using heatmaps and pair plots.  
- Detected missing values and outliers.  

🚧 **Next Steps**  
- Prepare the dataset for machine learning:
  - Handle missing values and categorical attributes.  
  - Create new derived features.  
  - Scale and normalize the data.  
- Split the dataset into **training and test sets**.  
- Apply and compare different ML algorithms.
